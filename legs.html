        <td><p>Squats are king because they're the most challenging leg movement you can do. <br>They work all the lower-body musculature and have been shown to spike muscle- <br>building hormone release</p></td>

      <tr>
        <td><img class="front" src="front.jpg" alt=""></td>
        <td><p>Shifting the bar from the back to the front of the body changes your squat dramatically. <br>Front squats emphasize the quads over the glutes and hams, which means you'll <br> sacrifice some of the load. It also helps you maintain a more vertical torso position,<br> which can help increase squat depth and perhaps decrease the risk of lower back injury.</p></td>

        <td><p>Deadlift variations are rightfully considered whole-body exercises, specifically for <br> the posterior chain. But research has shown that along with the hamstrings and glutes,<br> they definitely hit the quads.</p></td>

        <td><img class="dead" src="hack.jpg" alt="Hack Squat"></td>
        <td><p>A knock against machine-based leg exercises is that the hormone boost they generate just <br> doesn't compare to free weights. But that's not a reason not to do them! It just means <br> do them later in your leg workout when you're already fatigued.</p></td>

      <tr>
        <td><img class="dead" src="press.jpg" alt="Leg Press"></td>
        <td><p>Like hack squats, the leg press allows for a variety of foot positions to target the outer quads, inner <br> quads, glutes, or hamstrings. Just be careful not to lower the sled too far! This common mistake will <br> lift your glutes up off the butt pad and cause your lower spine to curl. A rounded back puts you at risk <br>for an injury</p></td>

        <td><img class="dead" src="curl.jpg" alt="Leg Curl"></td>
        <td><p>What makes this single-joint machine move worthy of being listed among squats and deadlifts? <br>Because too many lifters think those two exercises are "enough" for their hamstrings. <br>They're definitely not!</p></td>
