But research has shown that dumbbells elicit a  <br>greater degree of muscle activation, even if you can't lift quite as much total weight.</p></td>

The range of motion is also a bit longer, which can help maximize <br> muscle growth. Pressing in a seated position also removes the lower body, allowing you to focus <br> squarely on the shoulders.</p></td>

If you're hitting the rear pec-deck <br> machine, use a neutral or palms-in grip—not palms-down—to maximally activate the muscle.</p></td>
